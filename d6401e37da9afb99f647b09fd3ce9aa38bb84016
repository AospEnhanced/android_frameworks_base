      "message": "Thanks for reporting this, however - I am pretty sure, that something must be wrong specifically with your build-tree or the sequence, in which you apply the picks (in case you manually pick each commit instead of picking the entire topic).\nDo you have any uncommited changes or further commits in fr/base? or maybe on a test branch?\nTo be on the safe side, I have even freshly initialized a brand-new lineage-16.0 tree from scratch and applied all topics from P_asb_2022-05 until P_asb_2023-03 - it went fine without ANY issue, so it\u0027s definitely not my regular build tree, which is faulty.\nTip: Exclude the empty commits for build, as this can also cause issues - example for the February topic: \u0027repopick -it P_asb_2023-02 -e 349337\u0027",
