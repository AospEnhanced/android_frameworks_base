      "message": "Topic builds and installs fine on peregrine (Moto G LTE).\n\nAs discussed, I have specifically tested the \"PUK unlock vulnerability\":\n1. I could not exploit and \u0027bypass-unlock\u0027 the peregrine device with the previous build (before updating to Nov. ASB backport) . This does not mean, that Nougat would not be vulnerable in general, but the Moto G LTE, which I used for the test, isn\u0027t.\n2. Same after the update: PIN unlock, PIN reset, PUNK unlock and screen unlock work w/o issue - no regression, hence good to go from my perspective",
