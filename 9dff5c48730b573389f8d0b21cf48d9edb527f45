      "message": "Question: Is it on purpose that nw traffic gets precedence over other status bar icons? If I have it on the right, it\u0027s visible next to the center noth here and the wifi and vibration icon to the right are visible as a dot now. I thought the dot was supposed to be the leftmost (for right side) or rightmost (for left side) icon when space runs out?",

      "message": "I cannot try with crosshatch but I use the \"double cutout\" of the dev. options which is very large. Here I cannot reproduce the behavior that you see with crosshatch. Are the definitions of config_mainBuiltInDisplayCutout and config_mainBuiltInDisplayCutoutRectApproximation perhaps too small? I.e. smaller than the physical cutout?\nI never saw nw traffic (on the end side with large center cutout) be cut or limited \nby the center cutout.",

      "message": "At the moment the nw traffic is not included in the layout/system_icons group (containing WiFi, cell etc.) which collapses to a dot in case there is not enough space. Instead nw traffic is placed between the center position and the system_icon group (as well as the user switcher container).\nIn case nw traffic is configured to hide if there is no traffic, then nw traffic flashes only a short time to show the traffic while causng WiFi / cell to vanish. Without traffic the system icons are visible as before.\nAnd this happens only, if there is a broad cutout in the center of the status bar.\nOn the left (start) side it\u0027s the same situation. Here the nw traffic is between then center and the notification icons. The latter will also collapse into a dot if necessary.",

      "message": "I got a crosshatch meanwhile and analyzed the situation:\nThe (functional) size and position of the notch (in crosshatch) is defined as \"M -258,0 v 171 h 516 v -171 q\", i.e. a rectangle with X\u003d462...978, Y\u003d0...171.\nThe statusbar should reflect these dimensions, however, it does not.\n\nThe statusbar places the center field at the position X\u003d440...956, i.e. shifted left by 22 pixels (center at X\u003d698 instead of 720), therefore eating 22 pixels of nw traffic. The Home-button in the navbar however is in the correct center position.\n\nI made screenshots with the layout borders visible:\nhttps://filebin.net/q05pxc6vlm5m47ic\n\nIn \"0째\" the (left shifted) cutout zone is visible, and the \"180째\" screenshot shows, that even here the center-line is located at X\u003d700 (instead of 720). And the behavior is the same with and without nw traffic patches.\n\nAnother screenshot is made during network traffic. It shows, that everything is displayed correctly within the statusbar\u0027s (wrong!) bounds.\n\nMy surya test unit (width\u003d1080) shows a \"normal\" behavior, i.e. the cutout region (0째) X\u003d503...575 or center-line (180째) respect the center of X\u003d540.\n\nTherefor I postulate:\n\"The problem with the ill presentation on crosshatch is a problem of crosshatch not of this patch.\"\nI have been looking around in crosshatch\u0027s device part but do not see an obvious reason for this asymmetry in the statusbar.",
