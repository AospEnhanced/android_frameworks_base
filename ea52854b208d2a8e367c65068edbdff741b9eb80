      "message": "Thanks for the feedback. I have created a lineage 16 build for the OP3T now and flashed it to try reproducing the behavior, which you have described: \nIndeed, different from other devices (Osprey and P9 in my case, which I did test) and seemingly different from the positive test feedback from the others having tested this topic with with their devices - probably specific for the OP3T - the behavior described above happens on the OP3T device.\n\nAfter further doing some research, I found the solution. This is indeed specific to the OP3T device: The issue comes from the our \"friend\", the config panel (and was solved in higher releases). If you back-port the below commits into the lineage-16.0 tree, it will work properly:\n\nhttps://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_oppo_common/commit/fcd768e8a9a05e5d60ad1d418594c10bd09b4f1d\n\nhttps://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_oppo_common/commit/2ffe9b7d3c5ceb9b207fbcfb78bc7d153a4fa347\n\nTherefore, please +1 this commit, as the ASB topic as such is OK.",

      "message": "My success message was too early, after a further restart of the phone, the issue came back unfortunately! Nevertheless - I still think this is specific to the OP3T device and not a general issue of the topic.\n\nIn fact, after tapping the on/off switch twice, you can enter the PIN and the unlock key is also queried, so the device is usable - and since you had to enter the decryption key at start to get here, there is also no security risk of an unauthorized use of the device.\n\nOpinions of others?",
