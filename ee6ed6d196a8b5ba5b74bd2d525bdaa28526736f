      "message": "why was this removed? I know there are a few things that were deprecated in here, but some kind of real time listener is required I think. processPendingDataRestrictRequests() is no longer called which also called initDataInterface(). I think these are necessary for restrictAppOnData(key, mPendingRestrictOnData.get(key)); to launch which is necessary I believe",

I don\u0027t notice a big impact on my build, but I am ok with not using the code.\nAssuming that the power problem was the realtime part of it, we could maybe use https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/PhoneStateListener.html#onDataConnectionStateChanged(int)\nInterestingly though, other functions within this file use the RealTimeInfo variable...\nLet me know your thoughts",
