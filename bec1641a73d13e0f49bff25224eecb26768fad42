      "message": "I tried this with the \"double cutout\" of the developer options. The right-sided nw traffic text ended exactly with the visible region, nothing was missing. Is the notch-definition of the Pixel 3 not exact?\nThe overflow dot - so it seems to me - is more or less centered between the nw traffic and the last visible icon. However cell signal and WiFi signal seem to have different paddings (to fit nicely next to each other), so depending on the length of the nw traffic text and the remaining icons, the overflow dot seems to float more to the left or more to the right, without being always exactly centered.\nSo, I don\u0027t think that this can be resolved satisfyingly.",
