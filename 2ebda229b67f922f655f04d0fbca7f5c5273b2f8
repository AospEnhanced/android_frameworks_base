DEVICE_HOSTNAME\n4. android-ANDROID_ID\n5. android-r-RANDOM_NUM",

      "message": "I see, I didn\u0027t like it very much either, just tried to make it similar like it was before but with the new generation logic. Isn\u0027t 1 and 3 the same? CMSettings.Secure.DEVICE_HOSTNAME is the value I specify in https://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/173174/\n\nand on my device (titan) I already have a random generated hostname before the whole if block, so I need to re-set it here. The if could be changed to\nif (TextUtils.isEmpty(SystemProperties.get(\"net.hostname\"))\n        || !TextUtils.isEmpty(hostname)) {\nwhich would work if I don\u0027t have a hostname or if I need to re-set it, but this doesn\u0027t make it any more readable or easier, right?",
